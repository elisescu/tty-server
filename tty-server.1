.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBtty-server\fP is the server side for tty-share. It provides an instant pairing
solution, allowing you to share a terminal. tty-share is necessary to connect
to the \fBtty-server\fP, when the connection occurs a secret URL is generated,
through which the terminal can be viewed in the browser.
.SH OPTIONS
\fB-frontend_path\fP string
The path to the frontend resources.
By default, these resources are included in the server binary,
so you only need this path if you don't want to use the bundled ones.

\fB-sender_address\fP string
The bind address for the tty-share TLS connections.
tty-share tool will connect to this address. (default ":6543")

This will be sent back to the tty-share tool to display it to the user. (default "http://localhost")
.PP
\fB-web_address\fP string
The bind address for the web interface.
This is the listening address for the web server that hosts the "browser terminal".
